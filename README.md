## 👋 Hey there!

I'm Gabriel dos Santos Ferreira, a self-taught front-end developer based in Brazil. I'm passionate about building accessible, responsive websites and learning how the web really works behind the scenes.

I’ve been studying HTML and CSS deeply and building personal projects to sharpen my skills. I'm currently looking for my **first opportunity** in tech — open to freelance, internships, and junior roles.

### 🚀 What I'm working on:
- Personal websites using pure HTML & CSS
- Publishing projects on GitHub Pages
- Improving my English for future international opportunities
- Studying Git, JavaScript and web fundamentals

### 🌍 Goals:

- Keep learning and eventually work abroad
- Build a solid portfolio that reflects my evolution
